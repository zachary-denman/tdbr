tdbr: tunnel data browser, reloaded
===================================

tdbr is a python application that allows the user to quickly visualise shot data from the T4 Reflected Shock Tunnel at the University of Queensland. 

Motivation
----------
The previous iteration of this program, TDBrowser, was written by Dr. Peter Jacobs as a demonstration of how one may view shock tunnel data; it was never intended to be continuously used as day-to-day application by T4 experimenters. Also, over the years, new users have struggled to get the correct version of Tcl, along with the Refactored BLT Components toolkit, working on either Windows or Linux. The creation of tdbr is (hopefully) going to resolve this perpetual headache for new T4 experimenters.

Installation
------------

To be determined...
